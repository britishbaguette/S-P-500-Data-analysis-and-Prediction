# S-P-500-Data-analysis-and-Prediction
The S&P 500 dataset composes stock prices of 500 different American companies across various industries, in a period between early 2013 to early 2018. 
Each stockâ€™s data is stored in a csv file, where prices such as open, close, highest, lowest and trading volume are recorded on a business daily basis.
In this analysis, different datasets containing various combinations of features will be created, then supervised learning and Neural Networks will be implemented for prediction.

The target of prediction is the t+1 close price of CBOE, which is to be predicted using features such as different combination of stocks and their prices,
differnt number of lags, and finally the lagged prices of CBOE itself.
